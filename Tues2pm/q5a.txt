    char course[6];
    strncpy(course, "CSC209", sizeof(course));
    printf("%s\n", course);

If there is an error, explain what causes the error, referring 
specifically to the code. If there is no error show what the output is.

1. third argument of strncpy should be strlen(course)+1
2. did not assign null terminator to course after strnpy

c) 
    char course[8] = "CSC209 ";
    strncat(course, "Winter", strlen("Winter") + 1);
    printf("%s\n", course);

If there is an error, explain what causes the error, referring 
specifically to the code. If there is no error show what the output is.
